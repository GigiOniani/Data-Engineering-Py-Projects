========================================================Our Purpose========================================================
These CSV files collectively form the core dataset for a social networking platform.
They hold crucial information about users, their interactions, content shared, and reactions to that content.
Storing data, transforming and analyzing this data could offer insights into user behavior, engagement patterns, popular content, and connections between users.

after receiving source data, we implement transformation processes, and write functions that gives us some insights as well.

========================================================Instructions========================================================
main ->main.py initializes Pipeline, that includes processes such as(checking file existence, checking size, reading file using generator,data partititoning by post types, store errors, tranform data, list required people
and visualize social net networking.

utils -> _validate_friends_data.py_ combines data tables and validates if friendship exists between two friend IDs, then splits data into Valid and not Valid tables, in status column
